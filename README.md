# Gear Generator

This is yet another Gear Generator for Fusion 360.
I know there are a bunch of other tools to do this, I wrote this to scratch my itch, which were:

* Source code legibility - I at least wanted to have code as classes, and not a single giant function
* Fully constrained sketches - Many freely available scripts created gears whose sketches were not fully constrained. This led to funky problems when you wanted to modify or move the generated objects.

On top of the above, there were also a few minor issues that I wanted to see happen:

* Extra information - I know you don't need to draw the pitch circle or the base circle, but I wanted to see them. Also wanted to annotate them by text objects

# TODO

* Error handling: I have a few, but I should add more.
* User-friendly UI: Currently there's none. I suck at UI, so if you can help me, I'd be so happy.
* Distribution: I have no idea how to package and otherwise distribute these things on AutoDesk Marketplace. If you can help me with it, I'd be so happy.
